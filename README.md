# Keyfox ++
This is a fork of Keyfox, a simple, minimal OneLiner Keyboard-centered CSS for Firefox.

**Main Changes I made:**
- Fixed compatibility issues caused by new firefox updates. 
- Removed Clutter from Context Menus.
- Made the toolbar even more compact.
- Brought back the Minimize, Expand and Close window buttons.
- Moved the Find Bar (Ctrl + F) to the top of the screen.
- Made it strictly black & white.
- Changed the way hovering a tab works and how the tab close button is displayed.
- Customized its style to my own taste.

I tried my best to add as many comments as I could to make it easy to customize for anyone who isn't comfortable with CSS.

I don't really expect anyone else to use it, but if you like it go for it.

**I will probably keep it up to date, as this is the CSS that I will be using for the foreseeable future.**
